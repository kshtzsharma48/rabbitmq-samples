Summary
-------
Maven project containing various RabbitMQ samples defined as modules that I have been experimenting with.

NOTE: The RabbitMQ sample module "batch-amqp-itemreader-writer" has been deprecated as it has been merged into the Spring Batch project as of 2.2.0. See spring-batch-samples/src/test/java/org/springframework/batch/sample/AMQPJobFunctionalTests.java for more details.
