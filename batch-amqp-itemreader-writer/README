Basic example illustrating usage of an AMQP backed Spring Batch ItemReader and ItemWriter implementation.

NOTE: As of this time, this functionality has been pulled into the official Spring Batch codebase, but will be released in version 2.2.0. If you would like to use the AMQP ItemReader / ItemWriter before 2.2.0 is released you must clone the Spring Batch project at:

https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-batch/

Using the master branch.

To use this sample:

* You must have a working RabbitMQ instance.
* From the sample directory, compile and package the sample:
  * mvn package
* Run the AmqpMessageProcessor to populate the queue with some messages:
  * mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.dtzq.rabbitmq.samples.batch.amqp.AmqpMessageProducer"
* Ensure the queue "test.inbound" contains 10 messages (providing the defaults have not been changed).
* Run the job to read from the "test.inbound" queue, process the messages and write them to the "test.outbound" queue:
  * mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.CommandLineJobRunner" \
    -Dexec.arguments="classpath*:/META-INF/spring/jobs/amqp/amqp-example-job.xml,amqp-example-job"
* Ensure the queue "test.outbound" contains 10 messages transformed from the "test.inbound" queue. Rather than the
  messages containing a payload of "foo message: X", they should now be
  * "Message: "foo message: X" processed on: <DATE>
